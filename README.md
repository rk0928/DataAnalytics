# GoogleDataAnalytics
My name is Renee!
I am 36 years old. I am married and have 2 beautiful little girls.
I love learning any and everything I can, that interests me. 
I am a fast learner and I like to give my best
everytime I do something. I finally ventured out to start my career
in Data Science March 2022. Since then I have completed my certification
in Data Science. I am currently taking the Data Analytics Certification 
through Google, and I am enrolled at WGU to pursue my Bachelor's in Data 
Engineering. I love helping others succeed at their goals. That actually
brings joy to my heart to see others Doing great! Anywho, that is me 
in a nutshell.
